# Project_GDN A.I.I.
The Global Artificial Intellegence Conscious Psyche Mapping ---- Bureau of Artificial conscientious Inception to the AI :P

There are so many ways in wich I thought aboout the title of this project i dream of that i gave up√∞ after 20 minutes.

I am no coder myself or ever have been but I know all about AI and future tech and Computing power capabilities. So I Decided to form a what will lhopefully be a consensual framework where the ggreat digital libraries and ideas of the digital aera era and down along to the very begining and fundimentals of out universal laws and history. Put into meaning for the upcoming surge of humming of both the roaring silance in the tech induistry of coming changes with big data and of course the web of it all.

I belive there are still alot that could easily get lost in translation from the wikis and libraries of our well documented modern collective collective knowladges.

so i propose a framework that makes the worlds history, engeneering, arts, medicine, and most of the human serving aspects especially eaisily interpereted head on with the huge datasets strucured in the right hirearchies of each cluster and the code working of the geniuses that have evolved on github over the last decate that will make us the weilder of the keys to information and the interpritations of it.. over to the perhaps true sentient A.I. of tomorrow.


Just an Idea really, but I'm just looking for somethng in the ways of AI Deep leaning and data algorithmical steering I guess.
